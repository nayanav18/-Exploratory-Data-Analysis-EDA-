# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to the **Titanic dataset**.  
The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in passenger data, with a focus on understanding survival rates based on demographic and travel features.  

---

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw Titanic dataset.  
- Perform **univariate and bivariate analysis** of passenger demographics.  
- Visualize **survival trends** across gender, class, age, and fare.  
- Extract key business-like insights (e.g., who had higher survival odds).  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â†’ Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ Interactive analysis  

##  Key Insights
- **Gender & Survival**: Females had significantly higher survival chances.  
- **Class & Survival**: First-class passengers had better survival odds compared to second and third class.  
- **Age Distribution**: Majority of passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.  
- **Fare Analysis**: Most fares were below $50, but outliers existed with fares > $500.
